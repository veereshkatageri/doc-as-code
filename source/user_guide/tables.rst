Tables
++++++

This page is intended to show how **tables** can be used to documentation using reStructuredText \
syntax.


.. contents:: Table of contents
    :local:

There are three types of tables. And those are

- :dudir:`table` (a table with title)
- :dudir:`csv-table` (a table generated from comma-separated values)
- :dudir:`list-table` (a table generated from a list of lists)

table (a table with title)
==========================

.. caution::

    Using table directive can be tedious. It can be used when the format of the table is fixed and \
    requires no modification often.

The example of table syntax is

.. code-block:: bash

    .. table:: Truth table for "not"
       :widths: auto

       =====  =====
         A    not A
       =====  =====
       False  True
       True   False
       =====  =====

and it results to

.. table:: Truth table for "not"
   :widths: auto

   =====  =====
     A    not A
   =====  =====
   False  True
   True   False
   =====  =====

csv-table
=========

The "csv-table" directive is used to create a table from CSV (comma-separated values) data. CSV is \
a common data format generated by spreadsheet applications and commercial databases. The data may \
be internal (an integral part of the document) or external (a separate file).

internal csv table
------------------

The example of csv table syntax is

.. code-block:: bash

    .. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
       :header: "Treat", "Quantity", "Description"
       :widths: 15, 10, 30

       "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
       "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
       crunchy, now would it?"
       "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"

and it results to

.. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
   :header: "Treat", "Quantity", "Description"
   :widths: 15, 10, 30

   "Albatross", 2.99, "On a stick!"
   "Crunchy Frog", 1.49, "If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
   crunchy, now would it?"
   "Gannet Ripple", 1.99, "On a stick!"

external csv table
------------------

The example of csv table syntax is

.. code-block:: bash

    .. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
       :file: ../documents/doc-as-code/external_csv_table.csv
       :header-rows: 1 
       :widths: 15, 10, 30

and it results to

.. csv-table:: Frozen Delights!
   :file: ../documents/doc-as-code/external_csv_table.csv
   :header-rows: 1 
   :widths: 15, 10, 30

list-table
==========

The "list-table" directive is used to create a table from data in a uniform two-level bullet list. \
"Uniform" means that each sublist (second-level list) must contain the same number of list items.

The example of list-table syntax is

.. code-block:: rest

    .. list-table:: Frozen Delights!
       :widths: 15 10 30
       :header-rows: 1

       * - Treat
         - Quantity
         - Description
       * - Albatross
         - 2.99
         - On a stick!
       * - Crunchy Frog
         - 1.49
         - If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
           crunchy, now would it?
       * - Gannet Ripple
         - 1.99
         - On a stick!

and it results to

.. list-table:: Frozen Delights!
   :widths: 15 10 30
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Treat
     - Quantity
     - Description
   * - Albatross
     - 2.99
     - On a stick!
   * - Crunchy Frog
     - 1.49
     - If we took the bones out, it wouldn't be
       crunchy, now would it?
   * - Gannet Ripple
     - 1.99
     - On a stick!
